## About The Project

This repository will guide you through the process of creating a privacy-preserving, cross-chain token-gated NFT mint. The application enables the user to mint an NFT on Arbitrum Goerli, provided they hold Coinbase's 'Stand With Crypto Shield' NFT on Ethereum mainnet.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/ChaskinOnChaskin/sismo_walkthrough.git

2. Install the dependencies:

yarn install


## Building the App

The walkthrough includes detailed instructions on building, deploying, and verifying a smart contract on Arbitrum Goerli that accepts a ZK proof. If the user possesses the specified NFT, the system authorizes the user to mint a new NFT. 

This repository also encompasses the front-end web application built using TypeScript, Next.js 13, and Tailwind CSS. Rainbowkit and wagmi libraries facilitate wallet connection and smart contract interactions.
